Hello Professor Dong! If you remember, earlier this semester I was struggling with this assignment and you joined me on Zoom
to help me set it up. We succeeded, and I used that running version of FREENOS to complete the following projects. Unfortunately,
I have since done a factory reset on my PC, and FREENOS is no longer installed on it, so I can't show it. Please accept my other
projects and your own memory of helping me as proof that it was running on my computer. Anthony and I actually used my PC for the
majority of the code written on the other projects. I hope I can get at least partial credit on this assignment, especially
considering I've done well in all the other assignments for this class. It would be a shame to have this one late video submission
tank my grade. Whaterver you decide, thank you for considering.
